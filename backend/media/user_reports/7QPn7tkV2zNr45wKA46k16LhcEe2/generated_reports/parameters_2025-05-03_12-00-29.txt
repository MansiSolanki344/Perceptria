Here's a table summarizing the extracted test parameters from the lab report:

| Test Name             | Value    | Unit      |
|-----------------------|----------|-----------|
| Hemoglobin            | 6.5      | g/dl      |
| Total Cholesterol     | 108      | mg/dl     |
| LDL Cholesterol       | 28.5     | mg/dl     |
| HDL Cholesterol       | 50.9     | mg/dl     |
| RBC Count             | 3.67     | mill/cmm  |
| Platelet Count        | 417000   | /cmm      |
| Fasting Blood Sugar   | 98.0     | mg/dl     |
| HbA1c                 |          |           |  *(Not found in report)*
| Glucose               |          |           |  *(Not found separately, included in FBS)*
| Serum B12             | 128.3    | pg/ml     |
| WBC Count             | 7390     | /cmm      |
| Triglycerides         | 69.8     | mg/dl     |
| PCV                    | 24.4     | %         |
| MCV                    | 66.5     | femtolitre|
| MCH                    | 17.7     | pg        |
| MCHC                   | 26.6     | g/dl      |


**Note:** HbA1c and a separate Glucose test were not explicitly found in the provided lab report.  Fasting Blood Sugar likely encompasses the glucose measurement.
