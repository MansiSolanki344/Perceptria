|-----------------|-------|---------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hemoglobin       | 6.5   | 12.0-16.0     | Low    | Suggests anemia (low red blood cell count).                               |
| Total RBC Count  | 3.67  | 4.2-5.4       | Low    | Further supports the diagnosis of anemia.                             |
| PCV              | 24.4  | 37-47         | Low    | Low packed cell volume, consistent with anemia.                        |
| MCV              | 66.5  | 78-100        | Low    | Indicates microcytic anemia (small red blood cells).                   |
| MCH              | 17.7  | 27-31         | Low    | Low mean corpuscular hemoglobin, consistent with microcytic anemia.    |
| MCHC             | 26.6  | 32-36         | Low    | Low mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, consistent with anemia. |
| RDW              | 18.0  | 11.5-14.0     | High   | Increased red blood cell size variation, often seen in anemia.         |
| Serum B-12 Level | 128.3 | 211-911       | Low    | Suggests Vitamin B12 deficiency.                                      |
| Calcium          | 8.4   | 8.5-10.1      | Slightly Low |  A slightly low calcium level.                                         |


**B. Red Flags & Concerns ‚ö†Ô∏è**

Your results show you have anemia, which means your blood doesn't have enough healthy red blood cells to carry sufficient oxygen throughout your body.  This can lead to fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.  The microcytic nature of your anemia suggests a possible deficiency of iron and/or Vitamin B12.  The slightly low calcium level warrants further investigation.  Your slightly low Vitamin B12 level further supports this.


**C. Simulated Doctor Advice üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è**

It's crucial to schedule a follow-up appointment with your doctor to discuss these results further.  They may recommend additional tests to determine the exact cause of your anemia and address your slightly low calcium and Vitamin B12.  Treatment will likely involve dietary changes, potentially iron and/or Vitamin B12 supplements, and monitoring your progress.
