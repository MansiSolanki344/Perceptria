| Total RBC Count  | 3.67  | 4.2-5.4         | Low    | Further confirms anemia.                                                   |

| MCV              | 66.5  | 78-100          | Low    | Suggests microcytic anemia (smaller than normal red blood cells).           |

**B. Red Flags & Concerns ⚠️**

Your results show you have anemia, likely microcytic anemia due to the low MCV and MCH values.  This means your body doesn't have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen effectively.  Symptoms might include fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.  The slightly low calcium and significantly low vitamin B12 levels are also important to address.


**C. Simulated Doctor Advice 👨‍⚕️**

It's crucial to schedule a follow-up appointment with your doctor to discuss these results in more detail.  They may order further tests to pinpoint the cause of your anemia and low vitamin B12, which could be due to diet, absorption issues, or other underlying conditions.  Addressing the low calcium will also be important.
