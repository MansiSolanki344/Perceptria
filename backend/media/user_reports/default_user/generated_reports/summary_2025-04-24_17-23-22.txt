## Health Summary for Geetaben Vinodbhai Solanki (P-74106-24)

**Date of Report:** January 13, 2025

**Age:** 50 years

**Sex:** Female


This summary interprets Geetaben's lab results.  **It is crucial to remember that this is not a diagnosis, and a consultation with a physician is necessary to interpret these results in the context of her overall health, symptoms, and medical history.**

**Significant Findings:**

* **Anemia:** Geetaben's Hemoglobin (6.5 g/dL) and Total RBC Count (3.67 mill/cmm) are significantly below the normal range, indicating anemia.  The low PCV (24.4%), MCV (66.5 fL), MCH (17.7 pg), and MCHC (26.6 g/dL) suggest microcytic, hypochromic anemia â€“ meaning her red blood cells are smaller than normal and contain less hemoglobin. The elevated RDW (18.0%) further supports this.  The cause of this anemia needs further investigation.

* **Low Vitamin B12:**  Her Vitamin B12 level (128.3 pg/ml) falls within the deficient range.  Low Vitamin B12 can contribute to anemia and other neurological symptoms.  This deficiency should be addressed.

* **Slightly Low Calcium:** Her serum calcium (8.4 mg/dl) is slightly below the lower limit of the normal range. While this is a minor finding, it warrants monitoring, especially given her other results.

**Other Results:**

* **Creatinine:**  Within the normal range, indicating good kidney function.
* **Fasting Blood Sugar:** Within the normal, non-diabetic range.
* **SGPT (ALT):** Within the normal range, suggesting no significant liver damage.
* **Lipid Profile:**  Her cholesterol is very low (108 mg/dl), which is unusual.  Her HDL cholesterol is within the normal range, however, the low total cholesterol might suggest an underlying issue or dietary factors and requires further investigation.  The other lipid parameters appear to be in normal ranges.
* **Thyroid Function Test:**  All thyroid hormone levels (T3, T4, and TSH) are within the normal range, suggesting normal thyroid function.
* **Blood Urea & Blood Urea Nitrogen:** Both are within normal range, indicating normal kidney function.
* **Urine Examination:**  The urine analysis shows only a slightly elevated number of pus cells (2-4/HPF), suggesting a mild urinary tract infection (UTI) or other minor irritation.  However, the absence of other abnormalities is reassuring.


**Recommendations:**

Given the significant anemia and low Vitamin B12, further investigations are crucial to determine the underlying cause.  This might include:

* **Complete Blood Count (CBC) with peripheral smear:** To further characterize the anemia and look for any abnormal blood cell morphology.
* **Iron studies:** To assess iron levels and iron stores.
* **Folate levels:** To check for folate deficiency, another common cause of anemia.
* **Bone marrow examination:** This might be considered if other tests fail to identify the cause of anemia.
* **Further evaluation for Vitamin B12 deficiency:**  To determine the cause of the deficiency (e.g., pernicious anemia) and appropriate treatment.
* **Assessment of calcium levels:** Repeat testing to confirm the slightly low calcium.
* **Evaluation of low cholesterol:** To determine if there are any underlying issues causing this.
* **Follow up on mild pyuria:**  Treatment for a possible mild UTI might be necessary depending on the physician's assessment and may require a urine culture.
