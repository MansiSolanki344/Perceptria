⚠️ Areas of Concern

| Test             | Value | Normal Range    | Status    | Meaning                                                                        |
|-----------------|-------|-----------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hemoglobin       | 6.5   | 12.0-16.0 g/dl  | Abnormal  | Lower than normal; may indicate anemia.                                        |
| Total RBC Count   | 3.67  | 4.2-5.4 mill/cmm | Abnormal  | Lower than normal; consistent with anemia.                                    |
| PCV               | 24.4  | 37-47 %         | Abnormal  | Lower than normal; indicative of anemia.                                     |
| MCV              | 66.5  | 78-100 femtolitre | Abnormal  | Lower than normal; suggests microcytic anemia (small red blood cells).       |
| MCH              | 17.7  | 27-31 pg        | Abnormal  | Lower than normal; consistent with microcytic anemia.                         |
| MCHC             | 26.6  | 32-36 g/dl       | Abnormal  | Lower than normal; consistent with microcytic anemia.                         |
| RDW              | 18.0  | 11.5-14.0 %     | Abnormal  | Higher than normal; indicates variation in red blood cell size.             |

| Calcium           | 8.4   | 8.5-10.1 mg/dl  | Slightly low | Slightly below the normal range.  Monitor and discuss with your physician. |


B. Red Flags & Concerns ⚠️

The most significant concern is your low hemoglobin, red blood cell count, and related indices (PCV, MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW), all strongly suggesting you have anemia.  Anemia means your blood doesn't have enough healthy red blood cells to carry sufficient oxygen throughout your body. This can lead to fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, and paleness.  The slightly low calcium and low Vitamin B12 levels are also concerns and warrant attention.

C. Simulated Doctor Advice 👨‍⚕️

I strongly recommend scheduling an appointment with your doctor to discuss these results.  They may order further tests to pinpoint the cause of your anemia and determine the best course of action.  Based on the preliminary findings, supplementing with Vitamin B12 and potentially iron (depending on the cause of anemia), along with a nutritious diet, may be beneficial.  Your doctor will be able to assess this further and make the appropriate recommendations.
