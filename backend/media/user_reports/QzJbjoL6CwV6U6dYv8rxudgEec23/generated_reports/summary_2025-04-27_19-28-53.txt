## Geetanben Vinodbhai Solanki (P-74106-24) Lab Report Analysis:

This report shows multiple tests performed on Geetanben Vinodbhai Solanki, a 50-year-old female, on January 12, 2025.  Several key findings warrant attention:

**Hemogram (Significant Anemia):**

* **Hemoglobin (Hb):** 6.5 g/dl (significantly below the normal range of 12.0-16.0 g/dl). This indicates **severe anemia**.
* **Total RBC Count:** 3.67 mill/cmm (below the normal range of 4.2-5.4 mill/cmm), consistent with the anemia.
* **PCV:** 24.4% (significantly below the normal range of 37-47%), further supporting severe anemia.
* **MCV:** 66.5 femtolitre (below the normal range of 78-100 femtolitre), indicating **microcytic anemia**.  This suggests a deficiency in iron or other essential components of red blood cell production.
* **MCH:** 17.7 pg (below the normal range of 27-31 pg), consistent with microcytic anemia.
* **MCHC:** 26.6 g/dl (below the normal range of 32-36 g/dl), further supporting microcytic anemia.
* **RDW:** 18.0% (above the normal range of 11.5-14.0%), indicating **anisocytosis** (variation in red blood cell size), which is common in iron deficiency anemia.

**Other notable Hemogram findings:**

* **White blood cell count (WBC):** 7390/cmm, within the normal range.
* **Platelet count:** 417000/cmm, within the normal range.


**Other Blood Tests:**

* **Creatinine:** 0.56 mg/dl (within the normal range of 0.55-1.02 mg/dl). Renal function appears normal.
* **Fasting Blood Sugar:** 98.0 mg/dl (within the non-diabetic range of 70-109 mg/dl).  Blood sugar levels are normal.
* **SGPT (ALT):** 15.4 U/L (within the normal range of 0-45 U/L). Liver function appears normal.
* **Calcium:** 8.4 mg/dl (slightly below the normal range of 8.5-10.1 mg/dl).  This is a borderline low value and might warrant further investigation or monitoring.
* **Lipid Profile:**  Shows low cholesterol and triglycerides, which are generally considered favorable. However, the LDL/HDL ratio is low (0.6) which is unusual.  This should be reviewed by a physician.
* **Thyroid Function Test:**  All thyroid hormones (T3, T4, and TSH) are within the normal ranges. Thyroid function appears normal.
* **Blood Urea:** 18.2 mg/dl and BUN 8.5 mg/dl (both within normal ranges). Renal function appears normal.
* **Vitamin B12:** 128.3 pg/ml (in the deficient range of 32-210 pg/ml). This indicates a **vitamin B12 deficiency**.

**Urinalysis:**

*  The urinalysis shows mostly normal findings, except for 2-4 pus cells/HPF.  This might suggest a mild urinary tract infection (UTI), but further investigation would be needed to confirm this.

**Overall Assessment:**

The most significant findings are the **severe microcytic anemia** and the **vitamin B12 deficiency**. The low calcium level warrants monitoring. The slight presence of pus cells in the urine could indicate a possible UTI.  The patient should be referred to a physician for further evaluation and treatment of the anemia and B12 deficiency.  The cause of the anemia needs to be investigated (iron deficiency, other nutritional deficiencies, bone marrow issues, etc.). Treatment will likely involve addressing the underlying cause of the anemia and supplementing vitamin B12.
