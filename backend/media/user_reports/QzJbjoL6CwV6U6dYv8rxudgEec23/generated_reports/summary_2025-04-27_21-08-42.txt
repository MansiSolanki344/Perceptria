Health Summary for Geetaben Vinodbhai Solanki (P-74106-24)

**Date of Report:** January 13, 2025

**Age:** 50 years

**Sex:** Female


This summary interprets Geetaben's lab results.  It is important to remember this is not a diagnosis and should be discussed with a doctor.  The results show several areas of concern requiring further investigation and medical advice.


**Significant Findings and Interpretations:**

* **Anemia:** Geetaben's Hemoglobin (6.5 g/dl) is significantly below the normal range (12.0-16.0 g/dl), indicating anemia. This means her blood has a lower than normal amount of red blood cells, which carry oxygen throughout the body.  The low red blood cell count (3.67 mill/cmm), low PCV (24.4%), and other RBC indices (MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW) all support this diagnosis. The low MCV suggests microcytic anemia (small red blood cells).  The elevated RDW indicates variation in red blood cell size. The cause of this anemia needs to be determined through further testing.

* **Mildly Low Calcium:** Her serum calcium level (8.4 mg/dl) is slightly below the lower limit of the normal range (8.5-10.1 mg/dl). While this is a minor deviation, it warrants monitoring, particularly in conjunction with her anemia.  Low calcium can have various causes, including dietary deficiency, hormonal imbalances, or kidney problems.

* **Low Vitamin B12:** Geetaben's Vitamin B12 level (128.3 pg/ml) falls within the deficient range (32-210 pg/ml). Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to anemia and neurological problems. This should be investigated and treated appropriately.

* **Borderline Lipid Profile:** While her cholesterol (108 mg/dl) is within the desirable range,  the LDL/HDL ratio (0.6) is much lower than the normal range (2.5-3.5).  This usually indicates that HDL (good cholesterol) is very high relative to LDL (bad cholesterol). However, this result, along with the low cholesterol and triglycerides, warrants review to confirm accuracy and assess for any underlying condition that might be altering lipid metabolism.

* **All other blood tests (Fasting Blood Sugar, SGPT, Creatinine, Blood Urea, Thyroid Function Tests) are within the normal range.**  Her urine analysis is also essentially normal, showing only a few pus cells, which may be inconsequential or indicate a very mild urinary tract issue.


**Recommendations:**

Geetaben needs to consult her physician immediately to discuss these results, particularly the anemia and vitamin B12 deficiency.  Further investigations are necessary to determine the underlying cause of her anemia, including potentially:

* **Iron studies:** To assess for iron deficiency anemia.
* **Further blood tests:** To check for other vitamin deficiencies and evaluate kidney and liver function more thoroughly.
* **Bone marrow aspiration (possibly):**  In some cases of unexplained anemia, this may be necessary.


Her physician will likely recommend a treatment plan based on the results of these further investigations.  It's crucial that she follows up on these recommendations promptly.
