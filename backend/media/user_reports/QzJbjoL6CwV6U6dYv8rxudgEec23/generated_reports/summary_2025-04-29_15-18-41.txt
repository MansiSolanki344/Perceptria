|-----------------|-------|--------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hemoglobin       | 6.5   | 12.0-16.0 g/dl     | Low    | Suggests anemia (low red blood cell count)                                      |
| Total RBC Count  | 3.67  | 4.2-5.4 mill/cmm  | Low    |  Low red blood cell count, consistent with anemia                            |

**B. Red Flags & Concerns ⚠️**

Your most significant concern is anemia, indicated by low hemoglobin, red blood cell count, and related indices.  Microcytic anemia means your red blood cells are smaller than usual, and this often points to iron deficiency or Vitamin B12 deficiency. Your low Vitamin B12 level supports this suspicion.  The slightly low calcium level warrants attention and requires further investigation with your doctor.


**C. Simulated Doctor Advice 👨‍⚕️**

Geetaben, given your lab results, it's essential to schedule a follow-up appointment with your doctor. They can order further tests to pinpoint the cause of your anemia, particularly to assess for iron and Vitamin B12 deficiencies.  You'll likely need a blood test to measure your iron levels and ferritin (iron storage protein). Treatment might involve iron supplements, Vitamin B12 injections or supplements, or dietary changes depending on the underlying cause.  The slightly low calcium also needs a doctor's evaluation as it could have several causes.  Please don't hesitate to contact them!
